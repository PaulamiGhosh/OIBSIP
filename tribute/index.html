		<h1>Early Life In Congress</h1>
		<ul>
<li>Though he bagged the 4th place in the examination, he refused to work under the British government.</li><br>

<li>After hearing the turmoil in India, he came back and started the <b>Swaraj</b> newspaper for the promotion of the Bengal Provincial Congress Committee.</li><br>

<li>Netaji joined the non-cooperation movement begun by Mahatma Gandhi. Netaji was advised by Gandhiji to work with <b>Chitta Ranjan Das</b>, who was a politician in Bengal. Thereafter Netaji became a journalist, and commandant of the Bengal Congress volunteers.</li><br>

<li>In 1924, Netaji was appointed as the <b>chief executive officer</b> of the <b>Calcutta Municipal Corporation</b>, and Das as a mayor. Netaji was then deported to Myanmar since he was suspected of connections with secret revolutionary movements.</li><br>

<li>In 1927, after Netaji’s return from Burma, he found Bengal Congress affairs in disarray after the death of Das, and was elected as the president of the Bengal Congress. Soon Netaji and Jawaharlal Nehru became two <b>general secretaries of the Indian National Congress</b>.</li><br>

<li>In 1938, Netaji was elected as <b>president of the Indian National Congress</b>. He then formulated a policy of broad industrialisation which didn’t fall in sync with the Gandhian economic thought.</li></ul>
<h1>After Leaving Congress</h1>
<img src="team.png">
<ul>
	<li>Netaji left the Congress leadership positions in 1939 due to the differences between Mahatma Gandhi and the Congress high command.

<li>On January 26, 1941, Netaji <b>escaped from Kolkata residence</b> and, travelled via Kabul and Moscow, and reached <b>Germany</b> in April.</li>

<li> In July 1943, at a meeting in Singapore, <b>Rash Behari Bose</b> handed over control of the organisation of <b>Indian Independence League</b> to Subhas Chandra Bose. He then changed the name into <b><i>Azad Hind Fauj</i></b></li>

<li>In Germany, Bose came under the protection of a newly created Special Bureau for India. Netaji and other Indians in Berlin made regular broadcasts in different languages from the <b>Azad Hind Radio </b>sponsored by Germany. Through the broadcasts, he urged his countrymen to rise against the British rule.</li>

			<h1>Success of AZAD HIND FAUJ</h1>
			 On October 21, 1943, Bose proclaimed the establishment of Azad Hind Fauj, alongside Japanese troops, advanced to <b>Rangoon</b> and thence overland into India, reaching Indian soil on March 18, 1944, at Andaman and Nicobar islands and were renamed as <b>Shaheed and Swaraj</b> by him and moving into <b>Kohima</b> and the plains of Imphal.
			 On April 14, 1944, the Azad Hind Fauj captured <b>Moirang</b> in Manipur and half of Nagaland from the clutches of the British Empire. It was a fierce battle and one of the most difficult ever faced by the British forces in India, as admitted by the Britishers themselves. In a stubborn battle, the mixed Indian and Japanese forces, lacking Japanese air support, were defeated and forced to retreat; the <i>Azad Hind Fauj</i> nevertheless for some time succeeded in maintaining its identity as a liberation army, based in Burma and then Indochina.
